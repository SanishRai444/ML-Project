        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This project is an AI-powered pollution detection system that analyzes satellite data to monitor air quality
            across different regions. It uses heatmap-like images generated from Earth observation satellites to
            classify
            whether an area is polluted or not</p>.

        <h2>What Does It Do?</h2>
        <p><b>Monitors Air Pollution:</b> The system collects weekly pollution data from satellite sources such as
            Sentinel-5P.</p>

        <p><b>Processes Multiple Pollutants:</b> It considers gases like NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, and Aerosol Optical
            Depth(AOD) to assess pollution levels.</p>

        <p><b>Generates Composite Images:</b> The collected data is averaged over a week to produce meaningful and
            stable pollution heatmaps.</p>

        <p><b>Classifies Pollution Levels:</b> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to classify areas
            as either polluted or not polluted based on these weekly images.</p>

        <p><b>User Interaction:</b> Users can check the pollution status of any location by selecting it, and the system
            will analyze and show the latest results.</p>

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p><b>Satellite Data Collection:</b> Pollutant bands are extracted using the Google Earth Engine API.
        </p>
        <p><b>Image Processing:</b> A weekly mean image is generated for each pollutant.</p>

        <P><b>AI Classification:</b> These processed images are passed through a trained CNN model that predicts whether
            the area is polluted.</P>

        <p> <b>Result Visualization:</b> The system displays the classification result and can optionally show the
            pollution
            distribution in image form.</p>
